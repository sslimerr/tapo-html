# tapo-html
# Simple html interface that lets you control your Tapo devices

## Python switch folder
### You can use the files in the [Python switch](https://github.com/sslimerr/tapo-html/tree/main/Python%20switch "Python switch") folder to turn [on](https://github.com/sslimerr/tapo-html/blob/main/Python%20switch/on.py) or [off](https://github.com/sslimerr/tapo-html/blob/main/Python%20switch/off.py) any of your Tapo devices, just change the email and password and set your device IP.

## HTML control
### If you want to turn on and off your devices using an HTML interface you can do that using the [Html generic device control](https://github.com/sslimerr/tapo-html/tree/main/Html%20generic%20device%20control) folder, just go in [index.py](https://github.com/sslimerr/tapo-html/blob/main/Html%20generic%20device%20control/index.py) and change email, password and IP of your device, then set the IP of your machine and the port you wanna host the page from. You don't have to host it in your local network, you can delete that part of the code but you won't be able to access the page from another device.

Feel free to edit the HTML however you like i already put some CSS to make it look somewhat good and with a dark theme.
